``django-localized-fields`` is a Django library that provides fields to store localized content (content in various languages) in a PostgreSQL database. It does this by utilizing the PostgreSQL ``hstore`` type, which is available in Django as ``HStoreField`` since Django 1.10.

This package requires Python 3.6 or newer, Django 2.0 or newer and PostgreSQL 10 or newer.
